  WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

     A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
      It can accept inputs (parameters), execute logic, and optionally return a result.

  TYPES OF FUNCTIONS
    
  *)  Built-in Functions: Provided by PHP (e.g., strlen(), array_merge())

  *) User-defined Functions: Created by developers for custom tasks

  *)  Anonymous Functions (Closures): Functions without names, often used as callbacks

  *) Arrow Functions: Short syntax for anonymous functions (PHP 7.4+)
