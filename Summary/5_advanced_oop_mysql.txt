        OOP BASICS 
        ===========


  CLASS 
        A class in PHP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have

  ACCESS SPECIFIERS      
      1] public	
      2] private	
      3] protected	


       PUBLIC 
          Accessible from anywhere (inside or outside the class)
       
       PRIVATE
          Accessible only within the class itself
       
       PROTECTED
         Accessible within the class and its subclasses


       CONSTRUCTOR 
          __construct is a magic method in PHP. It is automatically called when a new object of the class is created.

         __construct() is used to initialize object properties when the object is created.


     The -> operator is used to access properties and methods of an object.
    
     $this->name means "access the name property of the current object."

    $student->show() means "call the show() method on the $student object."

   eg :
      class Student {
         public $name; // Property to store the student's name

         function __construct($n) {
            $this->name = $n; // Set the name when the object is created
         }

         function show() {
            echo "Name: " . $this->name; // Display the name
         }
      }

$obj = new Student("Sagar");
$obj->show();
