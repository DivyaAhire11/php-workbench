SQL commands are grouped into five main categories: 
   
   1] Data Definition Language (DDL)
   2] Data Manipulation Language (DML)
   3] Data Query Language (DQL)
   4] Data Control Language (DCL)
   5] Transaction Control Language (TCL)


**) Data Definition Language (DDL) : Used to define and manage database structure.

1] CREATE – Creates a new table, database, index, or view.
     eg : CREATE TABLE employees (id INT, name VARCHAR(50));

2] ALTER – Modifies an existing database object.
   eg:  ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary DECIMAL(10,2);

3] DROP – Deletes a table, database, or view.
    eg : DROP TABLE employees;

4] TRUNCATE – Removes all records from a table without logging individual row deletions.
    eg : TRUNCATE TABLE employees;



**) Data Manipulation Language (DML) : Used to manipulate data within tables.

1]INSERT – Adds new records.
    eg : INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice');

2]UPDATE – Modifies existing records.
    eg : UPDATE employees SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;

3]DELETE – Removes records.
    eg : DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;



**) Data Query Language (DQL) : Used to query and retrieve data.

1] SELECT – Retrieves data from one or more tables.
    eg : SELECT * FROM employees;

     ** Includes clauses like WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, LIMIT.


Data Control Language (DCL) : Used to control access to data.
 
 1] GRANT – Gives user access privileges.
    eg : GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;

 2] REVOKE – Removes access privileges.
     eg : REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM user1;



Transaction Control Language (TCL) : Used to manage transactions.

 1] COMMIT – Saves changes.
     eg : COMMIT;

 2] ROLLBACK – Undoes changes.
     eg : ROLLBACK;

 3] SAVEPOINT – Sets a point to rollback to.
     eg :SAVEPOINT sp1;

SET TRANSACTION – Sets transaction properties.

SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
